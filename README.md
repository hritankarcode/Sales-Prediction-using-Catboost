# Big Mart Sales Prediction using CatBoost

## About
This project implements a machine learning model using **CatBoost Regressor** to predict sales for Big Mart items based on various features like Item MRP, Outlet details, and establishment year. The model handles data preprocessing, missing value imputation, feature engineering, and provides a user-friendly Tkinter GUI for real-time sales prediction.
